## üöÄ What CodeWeavex Does

1. Reads your database model from C# classes using attributes such as `[FieldMetadata]` and `[IndexMetadata]`  
2. Reads the actual structure directly from SQL Server  
3. Compares both schemas and identifies all structural differences (tables, columns, keys, indexes, constraints)  
4. Generates safe SQL scripts to synchronize the database with the model  
5. Optionally executes the synchronization automatically  
6. Produces a detailed **HTML report** showing all differences and actions performed  
7. Can **export any database schema** to a standalone HTML document for review or documentation  
8. Can **export differences between model and database** to **JSON** or **XML** formats for automation or audit purposes  
9. Demonstrates record operations (insert and update) through the included **Sample** program
